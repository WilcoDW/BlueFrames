Plans for total rewrite, for (Blue)Frames 2.0

1. Use Dan's code style for local variables:
 All variables are prefixed with one small letter which stands for the type:
 Here are some examples:
 sText = "Hello"
 nTimes = 16
 tPeople = {"Mike","Bob"}
 bContinue = true
 
2. Create a local, 'shared' variable which all mods can use.
 Suggested names: tS tShared

3. Make processes (coroutines) control multiple (or zero) windows.
 (now one process has always one window)

4. Processes can use term.redirect(obj) to redirect to certain window.
 Windows-objects will have the same structure as monitor-objects, like in mon=peripheral.wrap("left")

5. A computer can choose per id to send his windows via rednet.
example:
tPermissions={}
tPermissions[4] = 1 -- Allows computer #4 to read all windows.
tPermissions[4] = 2 -- Allows computer #4 to read all windows, and send keystrokes (char and key events).
tPermissions[4] = nil -- Computer #4 can do nothing.
